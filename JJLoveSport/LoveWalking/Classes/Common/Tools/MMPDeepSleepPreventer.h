#pragma mark MMPLog

// Set up some advanced logging preprocessor macros to replace NSLog.
// I usually have this in an external file (MMPLog.h) which is maintained in its own git repository.
// I add this repository in my other projects as a submodule (via git submodule) and import the MMPLog.h
// in a project's Prefix.pch.
//
// For convenience reasons, I just include these macros here, so other people are not confused by
// git submodule if they are unfamiliar with it or simply don't have to bother and can use MMPDeepSleepPreventer
// as simple drop-in code.
